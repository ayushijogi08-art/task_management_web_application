📌 Project Description

This is a full-stack Task Management Web Application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in real time.
The application is built using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for persistent data storage. The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful API, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and scalable architecture.

Users can:
Add new tasks
View all existing tasks
Toggle task status between pending and completed
Delete tasks
See task completion visually through UI updates

The project focuses on real-world full-stack fundamentals, including CRUD operations, API integration, database interaction, and clean UI structure. It is designed to demonstrate practical development skills rather than just visual design.

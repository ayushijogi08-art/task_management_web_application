##📌 Project Description

This is a full-stack Task Management Web Application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in real time.

The application is built using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for persistent data storage. The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful API, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and scalable architecture.
